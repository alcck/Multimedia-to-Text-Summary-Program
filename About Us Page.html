            <h2>What Multimedia Is?</h2>
            <p>
                The main idea of the Multimedia to Text Summary Program is designed to automatically generate a concise summary of multimedia content, such as videos, images, or audio recordings. The program typically consists of several stages. 
                 </p>
                 <h2>How It Works?</h2>
                 <P>1)	YouTube API: If you are working with video content from YouTube, you can use the YouTube API to retrieve metadata about videos, such as titles, descriptions, and captions. This information can be used for summarization.</P>
                 <P>2)	Broadcast metadata: Broadcasting platforms such as television networks or streaming services usually provide metadata for their broadcasts, such as the title, description, and tags. This metadata can be used to provide context for the summarization task.</P>
                 <P>3)	SoundCloud: this is a multimedia platform that allows users to upload, share, and listen to music, podcasts, and other audio content. The platform works by allowing users to create an account and upload their own audio content, which can then be shared with other users through the platform's social networking features. It gives the ability to summarize multimedia content through waveform visualizations.</P>
